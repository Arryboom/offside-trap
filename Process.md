## Building
Initially this was supposed to be a decryption packer, however due to the 
complexity I've looked at implementing a virtual machine instead. The first
steps were to outline the different steps necessary for the full program, 
which are as follows:

1. ELF extraction
2. Bytecode conversion
3. Virtual Machine
4. ELF modification

## Issues
- Had problem with initial idea so moved to this
- Capstone has disassembly issue with offset
- Have to figure out ELF internals in a lot of detail


## Packer
 - Find each function from symtab
    - Only need those functions which have a correct preamble
 - Replace the return value for each function with a call back into the loader
 - Decrypt the code for each function after the preamble
 - Replace the preamble with a call into the loader for decryption

## Loader
 - Extend section at the end
 - Change the entry point for the executable
 - Store
